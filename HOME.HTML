    <p>A bus travels on the road and is used as a means of transport via roads. Typically, a bus can carry between ten to fifty passengers. Buses are commonly used as a means of public transport but they are also used by companies, organisations or even by a group of families for private transport. A public transport bus, has a ticket conductor along with the bus driver. The ticker conductor is responsible for sale of tickets and also for checking that all passengers have bought the tickets.The commonest and most beneficial use of buses is as a means of public transport. Buses run from one fixed destination to another fixed destination. These are generally far off destination with several halts at significant locations on the way. Many cities, towns, regions, states across various countries of the world have their own network and fleet of buses used as public transport. This is a great source of revenue for the local government. It is also a cost-effective and environmentally friendly way of transport for the mass public.Companies and organisations use buses for the daily commute of their employees and staff. Similar to the public transport these also ply over different routes so that employees from various locations can access this convenience. This saves a lot of fuel and transport expenses for the company and individuals too.</p>
